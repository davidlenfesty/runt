- Care about endianness in memory (specifically for reading .text)
- Get sim running w/ test assembly, verify li and add work for now, just to see
- Finish migrating to wishbone bus (it's pretty easy)
- Implement traps/exceptions system
- Implement system counters
  - CYCLE: clock cycles from arbitrary start time (i.e. reset)
  - TIME: wall-clock time (i.e. CYCLE/freq for this simple core)
  - INSTRET: instructions retired (does this include trapped instructions??)
